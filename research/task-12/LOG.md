# Task 12 Autoresearch Campaign

Destination: `research/task-12/LOG.md`

Task: `task-12`

Insights: [`INSIGHTS.md`](INSIGHTS.md)

## Campaign selection and provenance

Selected task: `task-12` (variational circuit to MPS overlap optimization).

Live open pull requests on `sxzgroup/ORBIT-Q` inspected on 2026-07-28:
`#2` (ForgeCode agent solver), `#3` (scoring-policy fix), `#4` (Fable 5
agent-axis run record), `#5` (GPT-5.6 Sol benchmark results). None is an
active Task 12 solution-improvement PR, so Task 12 is eligible for this
campaign.

Precursor research disclosure: the bottleneck profiling and candidate design
for this campaign were first executed on 2026-07-28 against the
byte-equivalent ORBIT-Q publication reference in the fork
`QingyunQian/ORBIT-Q` (branch `cursor/optimize-challenge-12-f598`,
`optimized_sloutions/challenge-12/`), on the same 4 vCPU cloud VM but with
`tensorcircuit-nightly==1.8.0.dev20260726`. All figures used for claims in
this repository were re-measured here in the pinned lock environment; the
external numbers are context only and are never pooled with in-repo
measurements. See `SURVEY.md` for the porting statement.

Campaign workspace deviation: this campaign runs in a single working clone on
the campaign host with branch `cursor/task-12-batched-su4-campaign-f598`
(Cursor cloud-agent branch-naming policy) instead of the
`codex/orbitbreakers/task-12/<opaque-id>` worktree-per-hypothesis layout.
Exactly one hypothesis edits `src/solutions/task-12/solution_12.py`, so the
one-worktree-per-hypothesis isolation is preserved in substance.

Engine deviation: the campaign host has no Docker daemon, so every in-repo
measurement uses `./bench ... --engine local` with a virtual environment
installed exactly from `envs/tensorcircuit-py311/requirements.lock`
(Python 3.12.3), the environment `sitecustomize.py` on `PYTHONPATH`, and
`NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1`. The `GOAL.md` Gate 3 Docker protocol therefore stays
closed on this host; local-engine paired evidence is recorded below and a
Docker rerun is requested in `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPARISON.md`.

Decision: `baseline`

Context only: the shared-container Docker bootstrap of 2026-07-27 measured
the same immutable reference at 11.261 ± 0.972 s under an 8-CPU/9-GiB
container on the maintainer host (`baselines/bootstrap-2026-07-27.md`), and
the ORBIT-Q publication record lists 6.12 s on an unspecified host
(`baselines/historical.json`). These numbers are not pooled with this
campaign's measurements.

## Reference bottleneck profile

Date: 2026-07-28

Scripts: `research/task-12/profile_reference.py`,
`research/task-12/profile_expm.py` (pinned lock environment, local engine
conditions). Sanitized outputs:
`profiles/reference-profile.json`, `profiles/expm-microbench.json`.

Findings recorded in `SURVEY.md`: the reference spends ~0.14 s on target
conversion, ~1.7 s on jit trace, ~3.4 s on XLA compile of an 8884-line
StableHLO module, and ~3.3 s on 5000 steps at ~0.67 ms per step. A scan step
containing only the batched 31-gate build plus gradient and Adam costs
0.381 ms with the norm-adaptive `jax.scipy.linalg.expm` versus 0.123 ms with
the candidate's fixed-order diagonal Pade(3,3); the per-gate `su4`
construction chain, not the tensor-network contraction, dominates both the
graph size and the step time.

## Experiment `e01`

Branch: `cursor/task-12-batched-su4-campaign-f598`

Worktree: single working clone on the campaign host (deviation recorded under
"Campaign selection and provenance").

## Hypothesis

Building all 31 SU4 gate matrices per step with one batched einsum against
the stacked su(4) generators and one fixed 2^5 scaling-and-squaring diagonal
Pade(3,3) exponential, applying them through `circuit.any`, and running the
5000 Adam updates inside one `jax.lax.scan` reduces the evaluator-reported
runtime by at least 3x while reproducing the reference trajectory within
complex64 round-off (falsified if any functional gate fails, if the paired
speedup CI includes 1.0, or if the early-step loss trajectory deviates beyond
round-off scale).

Pairwise runtimes (reference, candidate, speedup): (9.132, 2.324, 3.9299),
(9.040, 2.317, 3.9023), (9.023, 2.318, 3.8926), (9.163, 2.311, 3.9651),
(9.132, 2.323, 3.9312), (9.006, 2.331, 3.8629).

Note: the paired benchmark was executed against the exact candidate bytes
recorded in the hypothesis commit; the immutable report's per-row
`source_sha256` values equal the candidate and reference hashes above.

Trajectory equivalence (`profiles/equivalence-check.json`): the first 10
recorded losses match the reference bit-for-bit in float32 (max delta 0.0);
max delta 3.98e-05 over 50 steps and 1.27e-03 over 400 steps, the ordinary
round-off scale amplified by optimizer dynamics. The maximum su(4)
generator-norm bound over all 5000 steps is 3.6016 (scaled norm 0.1125 after
2^-5), far inside the fixed-Pade accuracy envelope measured in
`profiles/expm-microbench.json`.

Decision: `keep` (all validity gates pass; six eligible counterbalanced
local-engine pairs; candidate mean and median lower; 6/6 pairs won; 95%
paired-speedup CI excludes 1.0. The `GOAL.md` Docker promotion gate stays
closed on this host and is deferred to a Docker-capable rerun.)

## Failure signal and interpretation

No failures, timeouts, or invalid cells in this session.

## Next pivot

Track the pair-fused ququart formulation as a reference-derived variant and
measure it under the same paired protocol; request a Docker-engine rerun for
formal promotion.

## Append-only corrections

None.

## Variant benchmark: pair-fused ququart contraction

Date: 2026-07-28

Variant tracking commit: `3026f94b202bf91d1d5b7c8656e8ab5f23e6a030`

`5edd437829352c573b24ae2f9021ef6046c2cf53788a8b79c8811b8fe0e3103f`

This is a tracked reference-derived variant benchmark, not a second campaign
candidate; `src/solutions/task-12/solution_12.py` remains the e01 candidate.

Command:

```bash
./bench run 12 --solution fused --compare-to reference --repeat 6 \
  --engine local --timeout 300 \
  --output results/task-12-fused-variant-pairs-local
```

Environment, host, pair-order pattern, timeout, and measured region: same as
experiment `e01`.

(8.954, 2.143, 4.1786), (9.089, 2.117, 4.2938).

Interpretation: after e01's gate-construction fix, halving the contraction
network buys a further ~8% end to end (4.248x vs 3.914x); the contraction
was never the dominant cost. The variant stays PASS-equivalent with final
fidelities inside the reference's own run-to-run band.

Decision: `keep` as a tracked variant (same local-engine eligibility caveat
as e01).

## Post-merge scan-removal ablation

Date: 2026-07-29

`profile_factor_ablation.py` runs the identical fixed-Pade candidate objective
for all 5000 updates through either one compiled scan or 5000 dispatches of
the same compiled step. Three executions per path on the 6-CPU/7-GiB Docker
backend measured:

```text
scan mean execution:        0.913101 s
Python-loop mean execution: 1.159565 s
loop / scan:                1.269920x
cold lower+compile+execute: 1.836521 s vs 1.988862 s
```

All loss, fidelity, overlap, and parameter arrays were bitwise equal. Combined
with the existing `3.109x` fixed-Pade kernel microbenchmark and the `8.49%`
canonical pair-fusion increment, the report now attributes the dominant gain
to gate construction and treats scan and pair fusion as secondary factors.
